# Introduction to Stephen Tong
Hello! My name is Stephen Tong and at the time of the creation of this page I am a second year Computer Science major at UCSD.
I hope you enjoy this brief introduction of me as a programmer and as a person!

## My Life as a Programmer
As previously stated, I am a second year at UCSD, so most of my programming experience comes from classes I have taken up to this point.
I have currently dipped my toes into languages like **Java, Python, C, and C++**. I have some general knowledge of data structures and algorithms and am in the process
of planning out an app for the gym I plan to code this summer. I also have some experience using git (as you can see), markdown, and knowledge of terminal commands.
While I still have so much to learn, I am excited with my progress so far and hope to continue to progress my programming skills.

## My Hobbies

### Hannah
My number one hobby I would say is hanging out with my girlfriend. Her name is Hannah and we've currently been dating for a year. She plays for the UCSD softball team and we tend
to do nearly everything together.

### Gym
As for an actual hobby, I love going to the gym. I've been lifting since junior year of highschool and while my passion died down near the end of senior year and beginnning of college,
I've recently reignitied my love for lifting. I have been focusing a lot on bodybuilding and am planning on performing in an amatuer competition hopefully soon.


### My Friends
With the last bit of my free time, I typically spend it with my childhood friends when I get to see them. All of us go to different colleges within California, so we typically see
eachother pretty often. We love going to the beach, playing poker, playing Spikeball and any other kind of sport, and of course lifting together.
